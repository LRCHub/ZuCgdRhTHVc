I didn't say it
Y'all have a good time
Do what you want to

Everybody knows you've been steppin' on my toes
And I'm gettin' pretty tired of it
Steppin' out of line
And a-messin' with my mind
If you had any sense, you'd quit

'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now you better do some thinkin', then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

You keep a-packin' up my clothes, nearly everybody knows
That you're still just a-puttin' me on
But when I start a-walkin'
Gonna hear you start a-squawkin'
And a-beggin' me to come back home

'Cause ever since you were a little bitty scrawny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
You better do some thinkin', then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

You got the only daddy that'll walk the line
