Waited, Waited,
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes
Your daddy's home
Your daddy's home to stay
It wasn't on a Sunday
(Monday and Tuesday went by)
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon
(all I can do is cry)
but baby, I think I love you
In a special way
But baby, I love you
And I need you
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
I'm so glad
Daddy's home
Your daddy's home to stay
I'm not a thousand miles away
